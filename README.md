## Description
J. S. Jefferson is a digital butler that helps you with your routines. He is built on the droidOS framework.

**droidOS** is a new framework developed by [Intrinsic Creative](). It is custom tailored to interface with iOS Shortcuts. 
This means droidOS is able to complete system level actions that Apple does not expose to third party apps.
J. S. Jefferson, or just **Jefferson**, is the first implementation of a **Droid** using droidOS. His model number is **A001**.
droidOS is easy to understand and extend, making it possible for many more droids to be developed in the future.

Jefferson is build for programmers. To use him, you will have to write some JavaScript - but it's very basic, 
and if you aren't a seasoned programmer, he could be a good introduction to working with someone else's code.

There is potential for a companion iOS app in the future that would make him more user friendly and remove
the necessity of writing code. This may or may not happen, based on demand.

## Installation

1. To get started, you will need the [Shortcuts app from Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334).
2. Install the 6 shortcuts needed to run Jefferson:
   <br>a. [J. S. Jefferson]()
   <br>b. [Manual Action]()
   <br>c. [A001 Compiler]() OR the [A001 Dev Compiler]() (see note below)
   <br>d. [A001 Speech Engine]()
   <br>e. [A001 Weather]()
   <br>f. [A001 HiFi]()
   <br>*NOTE: Links are not yet live*
   <br>*DEV NOTE: if you wish to develop your own extensions for droidOS or Jefferson, you should install the dev compiler.*

More to come...
